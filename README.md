# CS231n at Stanford: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

This repo includes my solutions to the assignments of the Stanford Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition course offered in Spring 2019, taught by Fei-Fei Li, Justin Johnson, and Serena Yeung. 

Course URL: http://cs231n.github.io

I would like to thank the instructor and the TAs for making this wonderful course.
