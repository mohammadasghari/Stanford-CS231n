# Assignment 1

The goals of this assignment are as follows:

- understand the basic **Image Classification pipeline** and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)
- understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for **hyperparameter tuning**.
- develop proficiency in writing efficient **vectorized** code with numpy
- implement and apply a **k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)** classifier
- implement and apply a Multiclass **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier
- implement and apply a **Softmax** classifier
- implement and apply a **Two layer neural network** classifier
- understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers
get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using **higher-level representations** than raw pixels (e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Gradient (HOG) features)


## codes

### Q1: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier (20 points)

The IPython Notebook [knn.ipynb](./knn.ipynb) will walk us through implementing the kNN classifier.

### Q2: Training a Support Vector Machine (25 points)

The IPython Notebook [svm.ipynb](./svm.ipynb) will walk us through implementing the SVM classifier.

### Q3: Implement a Softmax classifier (20 points)

The IPython Notebook [softmax.ipynb](./softmax.ipynb) will walk us through implementing the Softmax classifier.

### Q4: Two-Layer Neural Network (25 points)

The IPython Notebook [two_layer_net.ipynb](./two_layer_net.ipynb) will walk us through the implementation of a two-layer neural network classifier.

### Q5: Higher Level Representations: Image Features (10 points)

The IPython Notebook [features.ipynb](./features.ipynb) will walk us through this exercise, in which we will examine the improvements gained by using higher-level representations as opposed to using raw pixel values.
